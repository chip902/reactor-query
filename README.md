# Adobe Reactor API Tool

This interactive tool helps you work with Adobe's Reactor API. It's built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and provides a user-friendly interface for making API calls using your Adobe credentials.

## üîê API Key Security

This tool requires your Adobe API credentials to function. Here's how we handle your credentials:

1. **Credential Input**: You'll need to provide:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - Organization ID

2. **Security Measures**:
   - Credentials are only used for immediate API calls and are never stored outside of your browser
   - Credentials are only used for the duration of the API call
   - All data is transmitted securely over HTTPS
   - Credentials are sent via the `x-api-keys` header and are Base64 encoded during transmission
   - The `x-api-keys` header is explicitly redacted in API logging. See `middleware.ts` for details.
   - No data persists between sessions

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Prepare your API credentials with a special read-only product profile. See the video on the [Settings](https://assistant.perpetua.digital/settings) page for more information.
   - Rotate your API keys regularly
   - Never share your API keys
