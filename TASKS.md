# Development Tasks & Conversation History

## Overview
This document tracks the major development phases and tasks completed during the transformation of the reactor-query application from a multi-page React Spectrum application to a unified Material-UI embeddable component.

## Major Development Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Project Setup & Material-UI Migration
**Objective**: Migrate existing React Spectrum components to Material-UI v7

**Completed Tasks**:
- ✅ Migrated all search components to Material-UI (MuiCompanyPicker, MuiPropertyPicker, etc.)
- ✅ Updated styling system from React Spectrum to MUI with Emotion
- ✅ Implemented consistent Material-UI theming across all components
- ✅ Updated forms, buttons, and input components to MUI equivalents

**Key Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/search/` - All search components migrated to MUI
- `/src/components/forms/MuiSettingsForm.tsx` - Settings form with MUI components

### Phase 2: Applet Consolidation
**Objective**: Consolidate multi-page application into single embeddable component

**Completed Tasks**:
- ✅ Created `ReactorQueryApplet.tsx` as main embeddable component
- ✅ Implemented internal navigation with sidebar and mobile drawer
- ✅ Consolidated all existing routes into single component with view switching
- ✅ Added floating theme toggle for dark/light mode
- ✅ Made component fully self-contained for embedding in other Next.js apps

**Key Files Created/Modified**:
- `/src/components/ReactorQueryApplet.tsx` - Main applet component
- `/src/components/theme/FloatingThemeToggle.tsx` - Theme switcher

### Phase 3: Property Scanner Enhancements
**Objective**: Add expandable components and improve dark mode compatibility

**Completed Tasks**:
- ✅ Implemented expandable rule components with JSON view
- ✅ Added rule execution order analysis and visualization
- ✅ Fixed dark mode code block visibility issues
- ✅ Made data elements expandable with JSON settings display
- ✅ Added proper theme-aware styling for code blocks

**Key Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/property-scanner/PropertyScanner.tsx` - Enhanced with expandable components

### Phase 4: Bulk Rule Editor Implementation
**Objective**: Create functional bulk find/replace tool for rule components

**Completed Tasks**:
- ✅ Migrated BulkRuleEditor from React Spectrum to Material-UI
- ✅ Implemented bidirectional data flow (search → preview → update)
- ✅ Added company and property selection with Autocomplete components  
- ✅ Created search-only mode (optional replacement text)
- ✅ Added component scope filtering (actions, conditions, events, all)
- ✅ Implemented real-time preview with expandable change details
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and user feedback

**Key Features Implemented**:
- **Find/Replace Functionality**: Search for text patterns across rule components
- **Search Scopes**: Filter searches by component type
- **Preview Mode**: Show changes before applying updates
- **Optional Replacement**: Allow search-only operations without modifications
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback during bulk operations

**API Endpoints Created**:
- `/api/reactor/updaterule` - Update rule attributes
- `/api/reactor/updaterulecomponent` - Update rule component settings

**Key Files Modified/Created**:
- `/src/components/bulk-edit/BulkRuleEditor.tsx` - Complete rewrite with MUI
- `/src/app/api/reactor/updaterule/route.ts` - Rule update endpoint
- `/src/app/api/reactor/updaterulecomponent/route.ts` - Component update endpoint

### Phase 5: Final Integration & Bug Fixes
**Objective**: Resolve integration issues and ensure smooth operation

**Completed Tasks**:
- ✅ Fixed property selection issue in BulkEditContent component
- ✅ Removed unused props and dependencies 
- ✅ Verified TypeScript compilation and linting
- ✅ Ensured all components work with internal state management
- ✅ Updated documentation and project context

## Technical Achievements

### Architecture Improvements
- **Self-Contained Design**: Entire application now runs as single embeddable component
- **State Management**: Proper isolation of component state with React hooks
- **API Integration**: Robust error handling and user feedback systems
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with drawer navigation

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Unified Interface**: Single navigation paradigm across all tools
- **Dark Mode Support**: Consistent theming with floating toggle
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Tools work independently with graceful degradation
- **Real-time Feedback**: Progress indicators and success/error messaging

### Developer Experience
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across all components and APIs
- **Material-UI**: Consistent design system with theme support
- **Code Organization**: Modular component structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README, CLAUDE.md, and TASKS.md files

## Current State

### Fully Functional Features
1. **Search Tools**: Text search, extension filtering, rule ID lookup
2. **Property Scanner**: Complete property analysis with expandable components
3. **Bulk Rule Editor**: Find/replace with preview and optional updates
4. **Additional Tools**: Publish history, library export, relationships, callbacks
5. **Settings**: API key management with tutorial video
6. **Support**: Contact form with email integration

### Integration Ready
- Component can be embedded in any Next.js application using Material-UI
- Configurable props for title, height, and initial view
- No external dependencies beyond standard MUI setup
- Self-contained state management

### Security & Privacy
- No data persistence - all operations are ephemeral
- Secure credential handling with Base64 encoding
- API keys never stored or logged
- HTTPS-only operation

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement component lazy loading for better initial load times
- Add virtualization for large search result sets
- Optimize API calls with better caching strategies
